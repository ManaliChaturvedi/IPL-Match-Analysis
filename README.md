# IPL Match Analysis AI Agent

## Project Overview

This project introduces an innovative AI Research Agent designed to revolutionize the analysis and interpretation of Indian Premier League (IPL) match data. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, this agent aims to overcome the challenges associated with manual data analysis, which is often time-consuming and prone to errors.

The core of this solution lies in its ability to process vast amounts of structured and unstructured IPL match data, extract meaningful insights, and present them in an easily digestible format. This not only streamlines the analytical process but also enhances the depth and accuracy of the insights gained, benefiting cricket analysts, sports researchers, coaches, and enthusiasts alike.

## Features

*   **Semantic Search:** Perform intelligent searches within IPL match data to find specific statistics, player performances, and match events.
*   **Auto-Summarization:** Automatically generate concise summaries of match reports and key incidents.
*   **Citation & Reference Analysis:** Trace historical match data and player statistics with proper referencing.
*   **Player Performance Recommendations:** Get data-driven recommendations for player selection and strategy based on performance trends.
*   **Team Collaboration Mapping:** Visualize and analyze team strategies and player interactions.
*   **Efficient Data Processing:** Handle large volumes of IPL data quickly and accurately.

## Technologies Used

*   **IBM Cloud Lite Services:** Utilizing various services for development and deployment.
    *   IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Studio
    *   IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Runtime
    *   IBM Cloud Agent Lab
    *   IBM Granite Foundation Model
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** For understanding and processing human language data from match reports.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** To enhance the agent's ability to generate informed and contextually relevant responses by retrieving information from a knowledge base.
